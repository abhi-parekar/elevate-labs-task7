# SQL Internship Task 7 - Creating Views

## 📌 Description
This task involves the creation and usage of SQL views for abstraction, reuse, and data security. Views simplify complex queries and help structure output data logically.

## 💻 Tools Used

## 📂 Files Included
- **`views.sql`**: SQL file containing view definitions based on customer, order, product, and payment data.
- **`README.md`**: This file documenting the task details and logic used.

## ✍️ What I Did
- Created multiple SQL views for:
  - Orders with customer details
  - Products with category names
  - Aggregated payment info
  - Filtered orders
- Used `WITH CHECK OPTION` for restricted view editing
- Showed usage examples for each view

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- `CREATE VIEW`, `SELECT FROM VIEW`
- Views for abstraction and reuse
- Views for filtering and aggregation
- `WITH CHECK OPTION` for safety
- `DROP VIEW` syntax

## 🔗 Submission
The GitHub repo contains all views and example queries for Task 7 completion.
